// we expand our reuse concept and invoke the dialog at component level
// previously, we created a dialog as fragment, to make it reusable across views or across our whole app
// but we placed the logic for retrieving the dialog instance and for opening and closing it respectively in the controller of the HelloPanel view
// sticking to this approach would require copying and pasting the code to the controller of each view that needs our dialog
// this would cause an undesired code redundancy which we want to avoid
// we implement the solution to this problem: we expand our reuse concept and invoke the dialog at component level

// the implementation of the HelloDialog reuse object extends an sap.ui.base.ManagedObject object to inherit some of the core functionality of SAPUI5
