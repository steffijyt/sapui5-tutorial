    <title>SAPUI5 Walkthrough</title>
    <!-- the process of loading and initializing SAPUI5 is called bootstrapping -->
    <!-- in this step, we load the SAPUI5 framework from our local webserver and initialize the core modules with the following configuration options -->
    <!-- src: tells the browser where to find the SAPUI5 core library – it initializes the SAPUI5 runtime and loads additional resources, such as the libraries specified in the data-sap-ui-libs attribute -->
    <!-- the SAPUI5 controls support different themes, we choose sap_belize as our default theme -->
    <!-- to make use of the most recent functionality of SAPUI5 we define the compatibility version as edge -->

    <!-- simple binding: contains only a binding pattern -->
    <!-- complex binding: combine texts and binding pattern -->
    <!-- to be able to use the so-called complex binding syntax we have to enable it globally by setting the bootstrap parameter data-sap-ui-compatVersion to edge, if this setting is omitted, then only standard binding syntax is allowed -->
    <!-- meaning "Hello {/recipient/name}" would not work anymore while "{/recipient/name}" would work just fine -->
    <!-- you can either use data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge" or data-sap-ui-bindingSyntax="complex" in the script -->
    <!-- by setting the "edge" compatibility mode, the complex binding syntax is automatically enabled, the edge mode automatically enables compatibility features that otherwise would have to be enabled manually -->

    <!-- we configure the process of “bootstrapping” to run asynchronously, this means that the SAPUI5 resources can be loaded simultaneously in the background for performance reasons -->
    <!-- we tell SAPUI5 core that resources in the sap.ui.demo.walkthrough namespace are located in the same folder as index.html, this is, for example, necessary for apps that run in the SAP Fiori launchpad -->

    <!-- in the bootstrapping script of our index.html, we enable the ComponentSupport module and remove the sap.m library -->
    <!-- then, we declare our component in the body via a div tag -->
    <!-- this will instantiate the component when the onInit event is executed -->
    <!-- we will no longer need our index.js from now on, because the descriptor takes care of everything -->
    <!-- the module sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport provides functionality which is used to find declared Components in the HTML page and to create the Component instances which will be put into a sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer -->
